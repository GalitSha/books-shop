      description: "'Fascinating' LA Times '[Keyes] has carried it off brilliantly, bringing not only a fine clarity but a special warmth and empathy' Washington Post Billy Milligan was a man tormented by twenty-four distinct personalities battling for supremacy - a battle that culminated when he awoke in jail, arrested for the kidnap and rape of three women. In a landmark trial, Billy was acquitted of his crimes by reason of insanity caused by multiple personality disorder - the first such court decision in history. Among the twenty-four are: Philip, a petty criminal; Kevin, who dealt drugs; April, whose only ambition was to kill Billy's stepfather; Adalana, the shy, affection-starved lesbian who 'used' Billy's body in the rapes that led to his arrest; David, the eight-year-old 'keeper of the pain'; and the Teacher, the sum of all Billy's alter egos fused into one. In The Minds of Billy Milligan, Daniel Keyes brings to light the most remarkable and harrowing case of multiple personality ever recorded.",

Your side, their side, and the truth . . .' Sharkish literary agent Jojo has just made a very bad career move - she's slept with her married boss Mark . . . Lily - Jojo's bestselling author - has just blown her advance on a house with new boyfriend Anton, only to come down with writer's block . . . Gemma used to be Lily's best friend until Lily ran off with Anton. Now she's pouring her heart out and a certain literary agent likes her style . . . Soon the fortunes of Jojo, Lily and Gemma are horribly entangled. But each is about to discover that there's more than one side to every story . . . 'It had me in tears . . . and, barking with laughter' Daily Telegraph 'A wonderful, subtle, hilarious and highly sophisticated novel.
